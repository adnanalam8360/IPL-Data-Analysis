## Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches using Python, Pandas, and Plotly. It explores key insights into team performances, match statistics, toss decisions, dismissal types, and much more through interactive visualizations and data-driven storytelling.

# 🔍 Key Insights & Visualizations
## 📌 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values using appropriate imputation strategies (mode, median, and placeholder values).
Converted date columns to proper datetime format for accurate time-based analysis.
## 📌 Match & Toss Analysis
Total Matches Per Season 📈 → Bar chart showing the number of matches played in each IPL season.
Most Tosses Won by a Team 🎲 → Visualized which teams had the best toss luck.
Most Common Toss Decision 🔄 → Pie chart comparing teams choosing to bat or field first.
## 📌 Team & Player Performance
Teams with the Most Wins 🏆 → Bar chart highlighting the most successful IPL teams.
Average Runs Per Match ⚡ → Computed the mean total runs scored in a match.
Highest Runs by a Batsman in a Single Match 🏏 → Identified the top-scoring innings.
Most Wickets Taken by Bowlers 🎯 → Ranked the top 10 wicket-taking bowlers.
## 📌 Advanced Analytics & Correlations
Total Runs vs. Wickets Per Match 🔄 → Scatter plot analyzing the relationship between runs and wickets.
Correlation Heatmap 🔥 → Explored dependencies between match variables like runs, wickets, and extras.
## 📌 Interactive & Animated Visualizations
IPL Winners Over the Years 📊 → Animated bar chart showing teams' championship performances across seasons.
Cumulative Runs by a Batsman 🏏 → Line chart tracking a player's (e.g., Virat Kohli) total runs match-by-match.
